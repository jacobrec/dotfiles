All my dotfiles in one easy place

## Warning!
If you are not me, I don't recommend running the unpack script without reading
in it detail. This script will aggressively replace all your configurations
with mine. It will change your git name to mine. It will delete your bashrc. It
will come into your home and eat your dinner. It's basically me, moving into
your computer. You have been warned.
